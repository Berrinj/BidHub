This is my semester project for semester 3 at Noroff.<br>
Fall 2024

## Description

Goal: To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.<br>
brief: An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings<br>
<br>
All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.<br>
<br>

### Project requirements

- "A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register"
- "A registered user may login"
- "A registered user may logout"
- "A registered user may update their avatar // I added the ability to upadte bio as well"
- "A registered user may view their total credit"
- "A registered user may create a listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description // I added the ability to update title, description and tags, and to delete listing"
- "A registered user may add a bid to another userâ€™s listing"
